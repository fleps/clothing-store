# WIP - Clothing Store | A React E-commerce custom project

This project was done as part of the course **"Complete React Developer"** from _"Zero To Master"_.

The course is not updated to use latest technologies, so I challenged myself to replicate what the course explained using more up to date approaches.

## Project Technical Details

- Node v18.16
- Project Boilerplate created using [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) v4.2 (Vite 5.1) (course uses CRA)
- React + react-dom v18.2
- React-router v6.22
- Sass v1.72
- Firebase v10.9

## Features (as part of the course)
- Login / Registration using Firebase auth with Google and Email/Password options
- Using useContext for Authentication, Products list and Minicart show/hide/render.
- Shop page with functional Add To Cart button + Minicart + Bag icon counter
- Checkout page with quantity changes + product removal

## Extra features added by me
- Minicart opens when adding an item from Shop page.
- Minicart closes/dismount when changing "pages" using React *useLocation*
- Minicart mount/dismount with CSS animation using *onAnimationEnd*
